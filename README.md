# Blueprint
Repeatedly create custom drag race and run it
For this to work, you need to have fast-travel unlocked, any class X car that
can easily win the drag race.
Do not use tune/designs by others as the game may ask you if you like them or not
Set the difficulty to Unbeatable, otherwise the game
may ask you to increase difficulty to get more CR if you keeps winning. Create 5 custom events at
Horizon Festival Drag Strip, make sure the last one has a car theme that contain the
car you intend to run the custom event. Car type themes recommended, since every car has a
car type and each car type doesn't contain too many cars. Do not use Anything Goes
since there might be too many eligible garage cars which may esult in significant loading time;
Head over to the Horizon Festiavl Drag Strip and press Ctrl + 4 to start the script
If things goes wrong try find at what stage the script went out of sync, and add 1000 ms to that stage.
